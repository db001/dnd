## Beginning

On waking the next morning the party emerge from the rooms to find [Harbin Westor - Wizard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/DaviusIronfist/characters/39410284) sitting at a table in the deserted inn.  He seems confident, capable and totally unlike the scared townmaster they know.  On closer inspection the party can see his pupils have a red glow.

> "You've caused quite a stir in this town, at first you seemed like the helpful bunch but now it appears that you bring chaos and violence with you.  We will have to find a way to deal with you, but first we will have a bit of fun.  First of all I'll leave you with a few of my new friends.  See you outside, possibly..."

Gets up a walks away through the door.  Physical interactions shows it to be a duplicate, that cannot be harmed and laughs at any attempt of physical damage.

Six [Imps](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/imp) appear around the room. (AC13, 10HP)

The bar is otherwise as it was left previously and hasn't been tidied up since the encounter the previous evening.  Chairs scattered and unfinished drinks still on the table.  The bodies of the guards and charred remains of the innkeeper still their.  However Tibor's body by the door has gone.

The exits either side of the fireplace take players to a long hallway.

### "One Way" Hall
A hallway that looks normal but ends in a solid  blank wall. On turning around there is a similar wall 5 ft behind you. You are now stuck. On the wall behind there isa parchment hung there with the words writing saying "keep your eye here and you may escape." The player has to look at the writing and walk backwards to escape the hallway.

### Countdown
Players enter a well furnished room with pedestal and switch in centre.  On activating the switch symbols symbols above the door start glowing, changing every second.  At the end of the countdown the door just opens.

You enter a medium sized room, in the centre is a stone pedestal with an iron lever on it.  Around the the pedestal are 6 stone columns, floor to ceiling. Each column has 5 glyphs engraved on it, top to bottom facing the centre.

Above the pedestal is a glass dome, fixed to the ceiling with iron fittings.  It is filled with a swirling green smoke.

At the far end of the room is a door, with 6 glyphs above it.

Entrance at the south of the room, exit to north.

The exit door is flanked by 2 burning sconces, any body part put in the flames takes 1d4 fire damage.

**East wall** - desk and chair.  Desk is roller top and closed.  On opening, ink well and blank paper.  Books called 'Elven Glyphs' and 'Puzzles and games', on investigation (DC10), either book will show that some of the glyphs are numbers.  Units on columns and tens above door.

Picture above the desk of a countryside scene, rolling hills, trees, grass and wildlife.  Items in foreground of the picture almost make it appear as if it's looking out a window.  Running or jumping into a picture hits the wall behind and does 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

**West wall** - Bed with side table.  Bed made and well furnished.  Unlit candle on side table and glass with clear liquid in it.  In the drawer are some matches and hankerchief with intials RH.

Painting above the bed of a large door, slightly ajar.

Dressing table with mirror, various perfumes, powders.  Names engraved on them are in Elvish, one of the perfumes is 'Escape', powder called 'Unlock'.  Mirror, has strange red tint to it.

On activating the switch all the runes light up.  Every second a rune on a pillar goes out, every 5 seconds a rune above the door goes out.

At the end of 30 seconds the unlocks and opens.

### Empty hallway
A short hallway, 10feet long with burning sconces along the walls, door at the far end but no other furnishings or decorations.  Halfway along the hall a false floorboard (DC15 investigation to find), fires an arrow from the wall when stepped on. +4 to hit and 1d8+1 damage.

### Blood Wall
The party enters a room with a stone wall and a locked door. The wall has a riddle engraved in it; *Use your head to paint me red, inside of thee resides your key. Be aware of what you spurn, for what you give shall be returned.*

(Alternative clue: *Use your head to paint me red, inside of thee resides your key. Be aware of what you spurn, for what you give shall be returned.* )

The party must use blood and smear it on the wall(where they get it from is up to them), and a duplicate of what the blood came from emerges out of the wall. The party must fight and defeat the duplicate to unlock the door.

### The Dark Staircase
Door leads to a small dark landing with an archway, an inscription above the archway reads,

*"The road may be dark, yet oft-times light does naught but blind"*.

It leads down to pitch-blackness.

Basically, the stairs are endless until they put out all sources of light. Characters with *darkvision* must close their eyes. The endless monotony of descending stairs takes its toll after a while, and eventually the PCs will have to start making concentration checks to avoid tumbling down the steps and taking superficial bludgeoning damage (1d4). Past a few hours, they might start suffering from temporary levels of exhaustion.

On closing eyes and extinguishing light, players step on to a flat surface and reach out to find an unlocked door infront of them.

### Games room
A room with three games tables, each with stools in front, and a dealer behind.  Only the first dealer will play, the others will point the player to the first table.  The dealer and two bartenders are all copies of the barkeeper that served in Phadalin.  They are [mages](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mage?fromList=Mage&Name=&Speed=&Type%5B%5D=humanoid%20(any%20race)#content).

**Game 1**
Each player rolls 4d6 and keeps them hidden, then puts out the one they don't want to use for all to see.  Then betting begins until all players call or have folded.  Betting is done with hit points.  Once the dealer hits 0 hp, the players can move on.


### Skills rooms
Corridor with 4 doors, 2 on each side and large double door at the end.  The double door has an eye engraved on each side.  It is locked and can not be opened by lockpicking or magical means.

Each of the four doors contains a different challenge, on completion of the challenge the players get a clue.  Completing the riddle will enable them to open the door.

>I can be open or closed, or big or small.
>I can reveal the truth or hide it. 
>I am almost always welcome and can spring up unannounced.
>Everyone has one, but not everyone shares.

Answer is *a smile*, smiling at one of the eyes on the double door will open it.

**Room 1**
Large statue of an knight in armour holding a sword.  A faint glowing semi-circle surrounds the entrance.  When a player crosses the line a figure of a knight emerges from the statue and speaks,

*"Brave warrior, defeat me and claim your prize."*

On defeating the knight the statue announces the clue.

If more than one player crosses the line then another knight emerges from the statue, if the player leaves the room the knight stops moving towards the player.

[Knight](https://5thsrd.org/gamemaster_rules/monsters/knight/) AC: 18, HP: 52, 2 attacks with greatsword +5 to hit, 2d6+3 damage.

**Room 2**
Seated statue of a woman with a onate gold and jewelled box in her hand, eyes closed and apprently asleep.  Every time a player crosses the line the eyes open an the voice speaks,

*"Who dares disturb me"* and fires a magic missile at 5th level (7d4+7) at the player.  The eyes then close again.

Players must roll a stealth check DC16 to avoid waking the statue.

To remove the box from statues grasp requires a sleight of hand check (DC20).  Failure causes the statue to wake and speak,

*"How dare you attempt to steal my belongings"* and attacks with shocking grasp at 5th level (+5 to hit), 3d8 damage.

To open the box requires a lockpicking check of DC20, failure causes the box to pulse with arcane energy and the player holding the box to take 3d10 necrotic damage.
