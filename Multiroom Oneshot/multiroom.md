### Room puzzles / Ideas

**Teleporting players** -  The players arrive in a room on a ledge with a long drop in front, several stones are floating over the drop with enemies on them.  Every round, characters roll a d6/8 to see which floating stones they get teleported too, including exit door.  Enemy holds key/magical item to unlock exit door.

**The Greatest Weapon** - A room filled with various weapon racks and all sorts of different weapons surrounding a statue of a knight with an outstretched hand, and a plaque that says "Bring to me the greatest weapon, that kings covet, puts warriors to ruin, and ends all battles." Putting any weapon in the hand of the statue causes it to become an animated weapon that attacks *Knight*. Among the weapons is a sword called "Peacemaker", with an olive branch wrapped around the rusted blade. Placing the olive branch (symbol for peace) in the hand of the statue solves the puzzle.

**The Maiden's Sacrifice** - Entering the room from the south, there is is large but almost enitrely empty room.  In the centre of the room is an alter covered in dried blood. There is a small drain hole in the middle of it. On the front of the alter is an inscription that reads "The maiden's sacrifice is necessary for life".  Dead body with a full waterskin lying next to the basin, self inflicted wound on the wrist.

Answer: Pour x-amount of WATER down the drain to open the far door.

Psychic damage - 3d6, dex DC 13.

On incorrect liquid poured down, each party member takes 3d6 psychic damage, halved on wisdom save DC13.

[Kobolds](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Kobold#content) appear and attack.

**Countdown** - Well furnished room with pedestal and switch in centre.  On activating the switch symbols symbols above the door start glowing, changing every second.  At the end of the countdown the door just opens.

You enter a medium sized room, in the centre is a stone pedestal with an iron lever on it.  Around the the pedestal are 6 stone columns, floor to ceiling. Each column has 5 glyphs engraved on it, top to bottom facing the centre.

At the far end of the room is a door, with 6 glyphs above it.

Entrance at the south of the room, exit to north.

*East wall* - desk and chair.  Desk is roller top and closed.  On opening, ink well and blank paper.  Books called 'Elven Glyphs' and 'Puzzles and games', on investigation (DC10), either book will show that some of the glyphs are numbers.  Units on columns and tens above door.

*West wall* - Bed with side table.  Bed made and well furnished.  Unlit candle on side table and glass with clear liquid in it.  In the drawer are some matches and hankerchief with intials RH.

Dressing table with mirror, various perfumes, powders.  Names engraved on them are in Elvish, one of the perfumes is 'Escape', powder called 'Unlock'.  Mirror, has strange red tint to it.

On activating the switch all the runes light up.  Every second a rune on a pillar goes out, every 5 seconds a rune above the door goes out.

At the end of 30 seconds the unlocks and opens.

**Choose Your Enemy** - Four mirrors as they enter the room, along with several other items.  Whoever looks in a mirror first - their duplicate will emerge from the mirror and attack.

**Well Sh!t** - Nothing in the room but a well, which opens out into a large underwater pool.  Door is at the bottom of the pool.  In the pool are [Sahuagin](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sahuagin#content)

### Door ideas

**Harry Potter** - Platform 9 3/4 (solid wall)

**Blood Wall** - The party enters a room with a stone wall and a locked door. The wall has a riddle engraved in it; *The key is found within you head, use the key to paint me red, be aware of what you spurn, for what you give shall be returned.* / *Use your head to paint me red, inside of thee resides your key.* 

The party must use blood and smear it on the wall(where they get it from is up to them), and a duplicate of what the blood came from emerges out of the wall. The party must fight and defeat the duplicate to unlock the door.

**"One Way" Hall** - A Hallway that looks normal but ends in a dead end. When you turn around there is a wall 5 ft behind you. You are now stuck. The wall appears solid. On the end wall there is writing saying "keep your eye here and you may escape." The player has to look at the writing and walk backwards to escape the hallway.

### Others

**"Infinity Stones" Gauntlet** - Find a gold gauntlet with empty marks for gems.  Find gems on the the player's duplicates that they fights.  All 5 means they can *click* to escape.

**The Dark Staircase** - There is a staircase with an inscription above the archway leading to it. It leads down to pitch-blackness.

The inscription I like to use is *"The road may be dark, yet oft-times light does naught but blind"* / *"Life leads us down dark roads, but sometimes it is necessary to see the light."* But you can use something else thematic. Alternatively, you can hide this in faint inscriptions down the side of the stairs.

The stairs are endless until they put out all sources of light. Characters with darkvision must close their eyes. The endless monotiny of descending stairs takes its toll after a while, and eventually the PCs will have to start making concentration checks to avoid tumbling down the steps and taking superficial bludgeoning damage. Past a few hours, they might start suffering from temporary levels of exhaustion.

If they turn around, the staircase is endless that way, too.

**Art Gallery** - Room full of paintings, if a character stops to look at the painting they get sucked in and have to deal with the contents.  The key is hidden in one of the pictures.

**Pitch black room**

**Automatic door** - Room with electrified crystal in centre.  Every minute the crystal fires a lightning bolt at the players (5d6 damage, Dex DC14 save).  A chain lies on the floor around the crystal.  Players can open the door by stretching the chain to the door.  The chain is 4ft too short and needs a player to complete the circuit to touch a hook in the centre of the door (1d6 damage).
